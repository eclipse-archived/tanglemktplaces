                    <h2>About WeWash</h2>
                    <p>WeWash is a service that makes the shared use of washing machines and dryers attractive to everyone involved. WeWash can be used via phone, website, or smartphone app (iOS, Android). Since April 2017, consumers can easily, safely, and conveniently book the next free washing machine or dryer - e.g. in the laundry room of apartment buildings or hotels. Waiting times or unnecessary walks to the laundry room are just as much a thing of the past  as the collection of coins or tokens, thanks to WeWash,. In principle, every commercially available washing machine or dryer is WeWash-ready: the Munich-based start-up, which was launched as a spin-off of the BSH home appliance group at the beginning of 2016, offers a cost-effective and easy-to-install retrofit kit. For landlords and tenants, WeWash is the clever and cost-effective entry into the smart home market. WeWash is led by Philip Laukart (CEO) and Dr. Ing. Rafael Kirschner (COO), who previously worked for BSH Hausgeräte. Further information at <a href="www.we-wash.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">www.we-wash.com</a></p>

The IOTA Foundation’s mission is to support the research and development of new distributed ledger technologies (DLT), including the IOTA Tangle. The Foundation encourages the education and adoption of distributed ledger technologies through the creation of ecosystems and the standardization of these new protocols.</p>
                    <p>The IOTA Tangle moves beyond blockchain by providing the world’s first scalable, fee-less, and fully-decentralized distributed ledger technology. The Tangle uses its own unique technology to solve three fundamental problems with blockchain technology: high fees, scaling, and centralization. It is an open-source protocol connecting the human economy with the machine economy by facilitating novel Machine-to-Machine (M2M) interactions, including secure data transfer, fee-less micropayments, and secure access control for devices.</p>
