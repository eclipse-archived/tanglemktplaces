                    <p>The next generation of industrial automation, Industry 4.0 (I4.0), is rapidly approaching. In tomorrow's world, devices will contain not only asset information, but proactive decision and optimization algorithms that enable goal-oriented behavior among their components. Such I4.0 devices can be viewed as autonomous independent economic agents that cooperate according to market economy principles.</p>
                    <p>The highly flexible value creation networks that result from I4.0 will require new forms of collaboration between companies - both at a national and global level.  And the successful implementation of I4.0 will depend on the creation of a common global communication and computing infrastructure that allows economic relationships between machines.</p>
                    <p>The Industry Marketplace is a vendor and industry-neutral platform that automates the trade of physical and digital goods / services and enables I4.0. Building on specifications developed by the Plattform Industrie 4.0 (Germanyâ€™s central network for the advancement of digital transformation in manufacturing), the Industry Marketplace combines distributed ledger technology, immutable audit logs, and standardized, machine-readable contracts with an integrated decentralized identity system, to enable secure communication and payments across the industry landscape.</p>
                    <p>By combining the latest technology with established standards and openly-developed specifications, the Industry Marketplace provides a platform for the economy of things.</p>
                    <p>The Industry Marketplace has been developed as an open source initiative and is free to join. You can run a simple trial at your office to explore its potential. We encourage open innovation with other industry partners to explore new business models and the many possibilities of industrial automation.</p>
