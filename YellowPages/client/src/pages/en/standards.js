                    <p>eCl@ss is the only worldwide ISO/IEC-compliant data standard for goods and services. eCl@ss contains tens of thousands of product classes and unique properties. This lets users  standardize procurement, storage, production, and distribution activities in and between companies, across sectors, countries and languages. The standard enables organisations to form novel collaborations, realise sales potential, reduce costs, and increase the efficiency of merchandise and data management.</p>
                    <p>Thousands of companies - including many global players - already depend on eCl@ss. The eCl@ss master-data standard is used both inside companies and when dealing with customers and suppliers.</p>
